        <h3>LOREN TODD</h3>
          <p>
            Loren Todd joined the Louisiana Tech Karate team in September 2007 looking for a different workout. What she found instead was a love of the martial arts that would forever change the course her life. Loren began training in earnest under Dr. David Jordan and Buster Cotton the very day of her first lesson. Less than a year after joining the team, she was appointed team President, a position she officially held until May 2012. She was the first female president ever appointed and also the lowest ranked earning the position as a green belt. Loren started to help teach karate through the program offered at Louisiana Tech and assisted in those classes every school quarter but two from her junior year through earning her MBA. In doing so, she joined the ranks of many Louisiana Tech Karate Team members to unofficially earn a minor in Karate. Loren began teaching children’s classes in 2011 where she found a whole new side of the martial arts and discovered the joy of seeing children work to achieve their goals.  When her sensei and mentor had to take a medical leave from leading karate classes, Loren took over his school as head instructor where she taught until July 2015 when she moved to The Woodlands.  Her enthusiasm and dedication to the martial arts lead her to open The Dojo & Fit Club of Magnolia with the goal of continuing to teach karate to her community.
          </p>

        <h3>DAVID TODD</h3>
          <p>
            David Todd began his journey in Kumdo quite unexpectedly and at a later stage in life. He stumbled upon a newly opened Kumdo dojang (school) and stopped to visit because the sword arts had always fascinated him. David immediately began his training under Master Bokhyun (Abraham) Oh and through tireless hard work and dedication earned the rank of Cho Dan very quickly. He has traveled all across the country to compete in tournaments. His journey proves that the martial arts can be a program for anyone regardless of their age. Together with Master Oh, David formed the US Kumdo Academy in 2010. Since then, David has worked to spread the ancient art of Kumdo in the community. He has taught in several different schools and venues before finally finding a permanent location at The Dojo & Fit Club of Magnolia.
          </p>

        <h3>TINA BRITT</h3>
          <p>
            Tina Britt is a black belt under the Atlee Chittim / David Jordan linage of Korean Karate. She started training in the martial arts at the age of twelve under Sensei Toby Sinclair. In 2009, she had the privilege to study and assistant teach under Dr. David Jordan, 10th degree black belt and National Director of the United States Karate Alliance, while attending graduate school at Louisiana Tech University. During her years of competing in the martial arts, Tina has won seven national championships, three world championships, and one national grand championship. She is looking forward to training a new generation of martial artists.
          </p>

        <h3>ANDREA NOSKRENT</h3>
          <p>
            Andrea Noskrent has been instructing fitness classes for more than six years. She has taught Zumba, Pilates, boxing, boot camps, and a variety of other dance fitness classes. Additionally, Andrea organized and coordinated wellness programs for employees at Cameron International, Exxon, and West Houston Medical Center.

          </p>

        <h3>MARYANN LOTT</h3>
          <p>
            MaryAnn is an AFAA Certified Fitness Instructor with 16 years of professional experience in the fitness industry.  She began her career in Woodland, California working as the front desk receptionist and sales associate at Oasis Club and Spa.  Shortly thereafter she began group exercise instruction as well.

        <h3>TAE KWON DO (KOREAN KARATE)</h3>
          <p>
            There are seven kwans or schools of Korean Tae Kwon Do.  The instruction of The Dojo & Fit Club follows the discipline of Chung Do Kwon which translates to “the gym of the blue wave.”  As in all schools of Tae Kwon Do, Chung Do Kwon places a major emphasis in training kicking techniques. The program encourages the development of muscular strength and flexibility while increasing cardiovascular endurance. In addition to the many physical benefits of Tae Kwon Do, students learn the importance of discipline and self confidence. Training in the Tae Kwon Do program will include several components: self-dense, practice in forms (kata), and sparring (kumite).
          </p>
        <h3>KUMDO</h3>
          <p>
            Kumdo is a traditional Korean sword martial art that has a very long and proud history.  In the 18th century, Kumdo was reshaped to its present form using a jukdo, a sword made up of four pieces of bamboo, and the hogu, head and body armor, making the art safer to practice.  With the jukdo and hogu, the style became more effective allowing stronger and more accurate blows without fear of injury.  Present day Kumdo has three components: inner strength signified by a loud yell (ki), the unbounded swing of the sword (kum), and physical strength (chae).  Together these components make up what is known as ki-kum-chae and is integral to both training and tournament competition.

          <br>
        <h3>KICKBOXING</h3>
          <p>
            Kickboxing can be traced back to the Muay Thai fighting style of Thailand more than 2000 years ago. However, the style became popular in the 1960s and 1970s as it evolved from a primarily self-defense oriented sport to a wildly successful competitive sport. Kickboxing in its modern form is a standing combat stance that allows both kicking and punching. The kickboxing program here at The Dojo & Fit Club is a combination of great cardio, instruction on the proper execution of kicking and punching techniques, and an overall full body workout. These classes are designed to be an energetic and fun exercise class with the added benefit of learning and practicing some effective techniques that can be used in self defense!
          </p>
        <h3>HIGH INTENSITY INTERVAL TRAINING</h3>
          <p>
            High Intensity Interval Training is a technique used to help you burn more fat in less time and quickly reach your peak performance. This full body workout is done by completing various drills at specific work to rest ratios designed to push yourself to the max and get in shape. Modifications can be made to ensure that everyone, regardless of fitness level, is getting the most out of their workout.
          </p>

        <h3>PERSONAL TRAINING</h3>
        <p>
          Having a personal trainer has many benefits including having an accountability partner, fitness routines geared to your specific goals, consistent and nonjudgmental support, injury prevention and rehab, and a maximized workout in a minimized time frame. Personal training can be purchased in one-on-one and two-on-one packages and can be scheduled at the times most convenient to you.
